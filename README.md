30 JAN 21: V 1.01
Minor error fixes. Toast notifications added to assist people trying to connect their devices.

This is a project that will allow 2 people to play Connect Four on 1) one device using the 1P mode (AI will be added at a later date), or 2) on two Android devices using a Bluetooth connection. Once the Bluetooth link is established, click on the Start 2P game to start a game. Checkers will be placed by doubleclicks. There may still be some errors in the win logic such that illogical combinations may trigger a win condition.
